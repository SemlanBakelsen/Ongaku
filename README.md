  ## Testing
* The website has been thoroughly tested throughout the making of the page. Viewed the page in multiple different sizes and configurations during the making the page.
* Tested the navigation links so that they bring the user to the correct place.
* Made sure that the form submission works so the user gets a valid response through Code Institutes [form dump](https://formdump.codeinstitute.net/). 

## Bugs
* When making responsive design the header and the navigation links would stack vertically. Was able to fix the problem by putting `Display: inline;` style on the navigation list items.
* Struggled for a while to get responcive design to work for smaller screen sizes until I removed my code tries and put `text-align: center;` on only 2 ids and it worked without me needing to change what size it should be.
## Validation
* HTML
     * Gave a warning regarding lack of header at the "Hero Image" location, where I don't use a header anyway. No further problems
* CSS
     * Passed the chack without any warnings or errors.
* Accessibility
    * I chose colors for the page that would be easy to differentiate between. And got good scores on the lighthouse test.
